# Visualizing COVID-19
Visualize the rise of COVID-19 cases globally with ggplot2.
## Project Description
Within months, COVID-19 went from an epidemic to a pandemic. From the first identified case in December 2019, how did the virus spread so fast and widely? In this R project, I will visualize data from the early months of the coronavirus outbreak to see how this virus grew to be a global pandemic.
